# Machine Learning Tutorial
This is the beginning of my journey of learning machine learning. I found this tutorial playlist by **NeuralNine** on YouTube, and decided it was worth following it through.

The files attached here are what was made as part of this, and I've tried to annotate where I could to explain what I understood from the tutorial.

These are the different files linked to the tutorials:
| Tutorial | File |
|---------:|------|
|     #2    | linear_regression.py   |
|     #3| k_nearest_neighbors_classification.py              |
|     #4| support_vector_machines.py               |
| #5 | decision_trees_and_random_forest.py |
| #6 | k_means_clustering.py |
| #8 | handwritten_digit_recognition.py |

I learnt multiple machine learning algorithms which are in the files above:
- Linear Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbor Classification
- Support Vector Machines Classification
- Decision Trees Classification
- Random Forest Classification
- K-Means Clustering

I can't explain their implementations, but I understand how they work and how to use them

The final part of this tutorial was making a more useful application, which was the handwritten digit recognition.
There are 10 PNG files attached which were my own handwritten digits, and I used these to test if the model worked.
On one occasion, the model correctly identified all of the digits.

Although it was a more surface level introduction, I have understood some things such as the algorithms but more importantly when I tried to jump in before, I got stuck with
things such as feed forward, neurons, and loss functions. Now that I understand these, I can look deeper into machine learning and eventually make something more advanced.

Thanks for reading!
